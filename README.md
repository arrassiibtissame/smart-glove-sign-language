# 🧤SignBridge — Smart Glove Sign Language Translator
> A real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system bridging communication between the deaf community and hearing users built as a Human-Centered AI capstone project.
---

## 🎯 What is SignBridge?

> SignBridge is an **assistive AI system** that translates hand gestures into text and speech in real time. A user wears a smart glove equipped with **flex sensors** and
>  an **MPU6050 IMU**, performs an ASL sign, and the system immediately displays the recognized word as **text and audio output**.

The system also includes an **interactive learning platform** for hearing users to practice and learn ASL signs.

This is a **Human-Centered AI system by design** the human is always in the loop, the AI assists communication, 
it never replaces the user's intent. If a gesture is misrecognized, the user simply redoes it. Control stays with the person.
