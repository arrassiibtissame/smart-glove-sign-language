# 🧤SignBridge — Smart Glove Sign Language Translator

> A real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system bridging communication between the deaf community and hearing users — built as a Human-Centered AI capstone project.

## 🎯 What is SignBridge?

> SignBridge is an **assistive AI system** that translates hand gestures into text and speech in real time. A user wears a smart glove equipped with **flex sensors** and an **MPU6050 IMU**, performs an ASL sign, and the system immediately displays the recognized word as **text and audio output**.

The system also includes an **interactive learning platform** for hearing users to practice and learn ASL signs.

This is a **Human-Centered AI system by design** — the human is always in the loop, the AI assists communication, it never replaces the user's intent. If a gesture is misrecognized, the user simply redoes it. Control stays with the person.

[FastAPI Backend]
  ├── /ws/glove   ← receives sensor data from glove
  ├── /ws/ui      ← streams recognition results to frontend
  ├── /start      ← REST: begin recognition session
  └── /stop       ← REST: end recognition session

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Hardware | ESP32-S3, Flex Sensors, MPU6050 IMU |
| Backend | Python, FastAPI, WebSockets |

## 🤖 Why KNN?
The current implementation uses KNN with a Kaggle dataset to validate the backend pipeline and WebSocket communication. The production model will be a KNN+LSTM hybrid — combining KNN for spatial gesture pattern recognition with LSTM for temporal sequence modeling. This architecture is currently in development by the team's ML engineers.

This is an applied **Explainable AI (XAI)** decision.
